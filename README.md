# Luigi's Picture Balatro
**A texture pack mod for Balatro that aims to recreate elements of Luigi's Picture Poker and retexture most cards into Mario themed ones!** (*)

## Installation 
* Install [SteamModded](https://github.com/Steamodded/smods)
* Put the LuigisBalatro folder in your Balatro mods folder.
* When you open the game go to `customize deck` and you should be able to select which suits to replace!

(*) *For the moment, it only replaces the `hearts` and `spades` suits but soon I want Luigi's influence to cover the game.*
